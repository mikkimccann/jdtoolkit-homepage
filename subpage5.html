		<h4> WHERE I GREW UP </h4>
		
		<p> I was born and raised in Sydney Australia to an American father and an English mother. Growing up in Sydney was amazing because I was so close to so many beautiful beaches and harbours. I went to an all girls school where I had to wear uniform from the age of 3 till 17. </p>

		<h4> WHERE I LIVE NOW </h4>
		
		<p> After high school graduation I moved to New York to pursue my passion for fashion design. Towards the end of my junior year I was given news that I had to leave school. Not wanting this year off to be a waste I decided to try and land an amazing job in my industry. After working 7 days a week at random part time jobs, I finally landed my dream job. This internship turned into a design assistant job with a salaried position being offered to me starting April 2020. As you can probably realise, this was just when the pandemic was gaining heat and KITH decided they couldn't move forward with the new hire. Without a job and a way to pay bills, I had to momentarily move back to Australia to earn and save some money up while living back at home. <p/>
		
		<p> While at home in Australia I worked out a way to get back into school and started classes in the NY timezone. Finally I was able to return back to NY and resume my senior year from my new bedroom. <p/>

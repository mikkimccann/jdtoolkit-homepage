		<p>This assignment is an extension of <a href="subpage2.html">ASSIGNMENT 2 . </a> With our logo in mind we had to create a poster that shared some kind of information to whoever was viewing it. </p>

		<p>I decided to make the poster my brand's announcement of the rebrand from the logo assignment. Using some themes like gradients, tearing, textures I tried to make the poster look like it had been wheat-pasted onto a wall. I also included some information about my design decisions when working on the logo assignment. </p>

		<p>This assignment was primarily testing our photoshop resizing, cropping and altering DPI but the last part asked us to be as creative as we possibly could. The image above is the result of that last part of the assignment.</p>
		
		<p> When I was in grade 6, the IT guy that worked at my fathers office gave me a torrented version of photoshop. I spent the next years of middle school and highschool teaching myself how to use the program. When people started posting tutorials on how to use Photoshop on youtube, the game changed and became a lot easier to learn new skills. I'm constantly learning new ways to do things and often will see an image on instagram or pinterest and will teach myself how recreate the desired effect.

		<p>I didn't have any direction or idea about what I wanted to create when I sat down to work on this task, but after a quick look on pinterest I realised I wanted to play around with halftone images which at the beginning of the semester taught myself how to make. I then decided on a colour scheme that I wanted to use and messed around for a day until I got the end result that I was satisfied with. </p>

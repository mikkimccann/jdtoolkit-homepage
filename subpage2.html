		<p>After our Photoshop assignment, it was time to work on Illustrator. We had to create a logo for a topic or brand of our choice. </p>

		<p>When I was in my final years of high school I started freelance creating logos and graphic packages for clients. I had never been introduced to illustrator and refused to learn properly because I was die-hard believing I could do everything I needed to on photoshop. I would only introduce Illustrator at the end to image trace which left me with a less then desired result. </p>
		
		<p> When I came to college I decided to take advantage of our subscription to Linda.com and started to learn Illustrator a little bit. Knowing Photoshop so well made it difficult to want to learn new ways to do things when I had my own way figured out. It wasn't until I went into the Fashion Industry last year and day one at my new job I was requested to update the CAD files on illustrator. Maybe it was my fault for giving them the impression I knew more than I really did. It didn't matter tho, I couldn't let them know I was less then qualified. For the first two weeks I went home after working 12 hour days and stayed awake all night watching online tutorials until I felt comfortable enough to perform what they were requesting off me. </p>
		
		<p> For this assignment I decided to update my own brands logo. I spent way too much time on three different logos. When one wasn't turning out the way I had pictured in my mind I got inspired by another idea. This left me with one finished logo and two that were not presentable as of yet. Watch this space for the updated logos soon to be added ;) </p>
